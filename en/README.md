# Easy Scripts

**by Otis C.**

## About the Repository

In this Repo you will find all of my "easy scripts".
The idea of the scripts is, to make my "tool bag" for every day use Linux tools a lot easier and more intuitive.
So I thought, that i wanted to share it with all of you

  - easy-gpg is my script to create, delete and manage my gpg Keys in the shell. Don't want to think to much about all the Commands. I just wanted a CLI Tool that handles everything for me.
